# nasa-photo-of-the-day
View NASA's photo of the day using NASA API

to get started clone this repo and open in your code editor.

the next step is to visit https://api.nasa.gov/ to generate your own NASA API key for free.  

once you have your api key create a new file in the root of the project called .env, this file will safely store your API key.  Define a variable in this file called REACT_APP_NASA_KEY and set it equal to your API key as a string.  the end result should look like this: REACT_APP_NASA_KEY="your-key-here"

save your progress open a new terminal window and run an install and run start, you can now view NASA's photo of the day!
